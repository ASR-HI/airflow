Current methods primarily focus on recognition of limited patient\u2019s motion intentions, with the purpose of controlling preconfigured gestures of a hand exoskeleton for grasping objects. These methods exhibit a marked shortfall when encountering scenarios that are unexpected or not designed in advance, such as non-preprogrammed hand movements and object manipulation tasks. To tackle this issue, large language model (LLM) and speech recognition technology are employed in this study to allow the patient to control a hand exoskeleton at will. In particular, two LLMs are tailored to formulate codes of either generating non-preprogrammed gestures or dealing with unencountered objects. Additionally, an incremental learning framework is proposed to enable patients to perform both predefined and non-predefined operation tasks by integrating a natural language parser with the two LLM-based learners. The natural language parser can directly control the hand exoskeleton to perform predefined operations tasks from prestored command set, while the LLM-based learners can incrementally expand the control command set so as to enhance adaptability of the hand exoskeleton to complex activities over daily use. This study is a pioneering work in the field of hand exoskeletons, which will revolutionize the way to control hand exoskeletons. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily generalized to any other robots by modifying the prompt of customized LLMs, which provides a new idea to achieve autonomous learning in robotics. Note to Practitioners \u2014The motivation of this article is to tackle the challenge of intention recognition for performing activities of daily living (ADLs) by stroke patients using a multi-degree of freedom hand exoskeleton. Existing methods for intention recognition so far can only be used for several tasks that are predefined in advance, thus none of them allow patients to control the hand exoskeleton completely at will. To surpass this limitation, an LLM-enabled incremental learning framework that integrates a hand exoskeleton controller with Large Language Model (LLM) is proposed and validated in this study. The framework offers patients an intuitive interface via voice interaction and enables patients to perform not only predefined operation tasks by the hand exoskeleton controller but also non-predefined ones that can be learned from the LLM. As a result, the hand exoskeleton controller continues to learn from the LLM, therefore is gradually able to perform all tasks in daily life. This pioneering study paves a new way in building patient-controlled hand exoskeletons with autonomous intelligence that can deal with non-predefined operation tasks in unstructured environments.", "Date of Publication": "02 April 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10489910/", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering", "Title": "LLM-Enabled Incremental Learning Framework for Hand Exoskeleton Control"}, {"_id": "672ed38614cae7071f1d95c0", "DOI": "10.1109/JIOT.2024.3471904", "Abstract": "The common-sense reasoning abilities and vast general knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) make them a natural fit for interpreting user requests in a smart home assistant context. LLMs, however, lack specific knowledge about the user and their home, which limits their potential impact. SAGE (Smart Home Agent with Grounded Execution), overcomes these and other limitations by using a scheme in which a user request triggers an LLM-controlled sequence of discrete actions. These actions can be used to retrieve information, interact with the user, or manipulate device states. SAGE controls this process through a dynamically constructed tree of LLM prompts, which help it decide which action to take next, whether an action was successful, and when to terminate the process. The SAGE action set augments an LLM\u2019s capabilities to support some of the most critical requirements for a smart home assistant.

In China, the current CSoLC adopts the China liver cancer (CNLC) staging, which is usually evaluated by clinicians based on the patient's radiology reports. Therefore, inferring clinical information from unstructured radiology reports can provide auxiliary decision support for clinicians. The key to solving the challenging task is to guide the model to pay attention to the staging-related words or sentences, and the following issues may occur: 1) Imbalanced categories: The symptoms of liver cancer in the early- or mid-stage are not obvious, resulting in more data in the end-stage. 2) Domain sensitivity of liver cancer data: The liver cancer dataset contains a large amount of domain knowledge, and the conventional methods can exacerbate out-of-vocabulary, which greatly affects the accuracy of classification. 3) Free-text and lengthy report: The radiology report of liver cancer sparsely describes various lesions with domain-specific terms, which poses difficulties in mining key information related to staging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a large language model (LLM)-based Knowledge-aware Attention Network (LKAN) for CSoLC. First, for maintaining semantic consistency, LLM and a rule-based algorithm are integrated to generate more diverse and reasonable data. Second, unlabeled radiology corpus of liver cancer are pre-trained to introduce domain knowledge for subsequent representation learning. Third, attention is improved by incorporating both global and local features, which can provide professional guidance for the classifier to focus on the important information. Compared with the baseline models, the classification accuracy of LKAN has achieved the best results with 90.3% Accuracy, 90.0% Macro_F1 score, and 90.0% Macro_Recall.

Consequently, many organizations are investing in or acquiring insider threat detection systems to mitigate internal risks. However, three critical challenges emerge: 1) Client data frequently manifests as isolated islands, hindering information sharing without jeopardizing privacy and security. Moreover, data islands result in insufficient data for clients to train robust detection models effectively. Furthermore, it is hard for them to identify new or unknown attacks. 2) The heterogeneity, diversity, and personalized nature of clients preclude the utilization of a universal model to detect insider threats across all clients. A tailored client model adaptable to each client\u2019s specifications is imperative. 3) The daunting obstacle of expensive resource overhead, time delay and apprehensions regarding data security hinder the establishment of an effective internal threat detection system. This paper introduces FedITD, the inaugural federated Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PETuning) of Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transfer Learning (TL) framework designed for insider threat detection, aimed at addressing these challenges. FedITD facilitates information integration across clients while safeguarding the privacy of each client through federated learning (FL). To evaluate the detection performance, and mitigate the resource costs, as well as concerns regarding data privacy, this study investigates three representative PETuning approaches (Adapter, BitFit, and LoRA) applied to four Pre-trained Large Language Models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT). The findings indicate that Federated PETuning maintains acceptable performance levels while effectively reducing resource consumption and safeguarding against privacy attacks. Subsequently, it constructs custom client models via transfer learning without transmitting data to the central server. As a result, FedITD exhibits exceptional generalization ability, significantly enhancing the detection of new or unknown attacks. Extensive experimental results reveal several key insights: 1) FedITD outperforms other federated learning methods and nearly all centrally trained insider threat detection methods. Its performance is very close to the best performer using central training 2) LoRA tuning achieves optimal performance when paired with the robust pre-trained model RoBERTa. 3) FedITD significantly reduces communication costs, memory overhead, storage costs, and time delay. 4) Compared to full-tuning or PETuning the model on local data post-FL, only TF method, or only FL method, FedITD demonstrates superior performance in both local test and global test by mitigating overfitting issues and leveraging insights from other clients. 5) FedITD can be well adapted to both slightly and highly heterogeneous unlabeled target data domains and exhibits exceptional generalization ability to detect new or unknown attacks.", "Date of Publication": "17 October 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10721229/", "Published In": "IEEE Access", "Title": "FedITD: A Federated Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Pre-trained Large Language Models and Transfer Learning Framework for Insider Threat Detection"}, {"_id": "672ed38914cae7071f1d9782", "DOI": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3427369", "Abstract": "As the ubiquity and complexity of system-on-chip (SoC) designs increase across electronic devices, incorporating security into an SoC design flow poses significant challenges.

However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions.

To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization.

We conducted three experiments and tested four common bar chart layouts: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. In Experiment 1, we identified the optimal configurations to generate meaningful chart takeaways by testing four LLMs, two temperature settings, nine chart specifications, and two prompting strategies.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are introduced to mitigate security threats. However, existing ML/DL-based IDS suffer from challenges in IoV environments. First, due to the limitations of ML/DLbased methods, classification performance is unsatisfactory when they extract only unidirectional contextual features or spatial characteristics. Second, existing research on in-vehicle network IDS often limits validation and testing to a static dataset of a single vehicle model. This approach may not adequately address diverse potential attacks in a dynamic environment. Third, few studies of hybrid IDS can simultaneously implement in-vehicle and extra-vehicle network intrusion detection.

To conform to the BERT model, the semantic extractor is introduced to transform traffic data devoid of apparent semantics into contextual semantics, comprising bidirectional and unidirectional SE.

These features can be adapted to downstream tasks in both in-vehicle and extravehicle networks through fine-tuning.

In particular, we present the feasibility of NetGPT by leveraging low-rank adaptation-based fine-tuning of open-source LLMs (i.e., GPT-2-base model and LLaMA model), and conduct comprehensive numerical comparisons with alternative cloud-edge collaboration or cloud-only techniques, so as to demonstrate the superiority of NetGPT. Subsequently, we highlight the essential changes required for an artificial intelligence (AI)-native network architecture towards NetGPT, with emphasis on deeper integration of communications and computing resources and careful calibration of logical AI workflow. Furthermore, we demonstrate several benefits of NetGPT, which come as by-products, as the edge LLMs\u2019 capability to predict trends and infer intents promises a unified solution for intelligent network management & orchestration.

In today\u2019s digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks.

Integrating LLMs with the capabilities of retrieval, planning, memory, evaluation, and reflection in agents can greatly enhance the potential of LLMs for 6G communications. To this end, we propose CommLLM, a multi-agent system with customized communication knowledge and tools for solving communication-related tasks using natural language.

Previous works approach this problem from topic- and entity-based perspectives, but the capability of the underlying NLP model limits their effectiveness. Recent advances in prompting with LLMs present opportunities to enhance such approaches with higher accuracy and customizability. However, poorly designed prompts and visualizations could mislead users into falsely interpreting the visualizations and hinder the system's trustworthiness. In this paper, we address this issue by taking into account the user analysis tasks and visualization goals in the prompt-based data extraction stage, thereby extending the concept of Model Alignment. We present HINTs, a VA system for supporting sensemaking on large collections of documents, combining previous entity-based and topic-based approaches. The visualization pipeline of HINTs consists of three stages. First, entities and topics are extracted from the corpus with prompts. Then, the result is modeled as a hypergraph and hierarchically clustered. Finally, an enhanced space-filling curve layout is applied to visualize the hypergraph for interactive exploration. The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate the sensemaking of interested documents. To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study.

While machine learning models have been used to predict flakiness and its root causes, there is much less work on providing support to fix the problem. To address this gap, in this paper, we focus on predicting the type of fix that is required to remove flakiness and then repair the test code on that basis. We do this for a subset of flaky tests where the root cause of flakiness is in the test itself and not in the production code. One key idea is to guide the repair process with additional knowledge about the test\u2019s flakiness in the form of its predicted fix category. Thus, we first propose a framework that automatically generates labeled datasets for 13 fix categories and trains models to predict the fix category of a flaky test by analyzing the test code only. Our experimental results using code models and few-shot learning show that we can correctly predict most of the fix categories. To show the usefulness of such fix category labels for automatically repairing flakiness, we augment the prompts of GPT 3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), with such extra knowledge to request repair suggestions. The results show that our suggested fix category labels, complemented with in-context learning, significantly enhance the capability of GPT 3.5 Turbo in generating fixes for flaky tests. Based on the execution and analysis of a sample of GPT-repaired flaky tests, we estimate that a large percentage of such repairs, (roughly between 51% and 83%) can be expected to pass.

First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements.

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain adopts a graph structure of a single transaction as the basic unit, and it has the characteristics of asynchronous consensus. Some existing studies use DAGblockchain to replace the traditional blockchain to alleviate its low throughput problems like IOTA. However, with the rapid data generation in the IIoT environment, the topology scale of DAG-blockchain will increase sharply, which will aggravate the data storage cost of blockchain nodes. In this article, to reduce the data storage cost of edge servers, we design a Graphpartition based storage strategy for DAG-Blockchain (GpDB), equipped with a graph partition algorithm based on transaction freshness, which can partition DAG-blockchain topology in edge servers into two parts, which will be retained and removed respectively.

Blockchain consensus mechanisms (CMs) are key to enabling nodes in a wireless network to achieve consistency without any trusted entity. However, consensus reliability will be seriously affected by the instability of communication links in wireless networks. Meanwhile, it is difficult for nodes in wireless scenarios to obtain a timely energy supply. Energy-intensive blockchain functions can quickly drain the power of nodes, thus degrading consensus performance. Fortunately, a symbiotic radio (SR) system enabled by cognitive backscatter communications can solve the above problems. In SR, the secondary transmitter (STx) transmits messages over the radio frequency (RF) signal emitted from a primary transmitter (PTx) with extremely low energy consumption, and the STx can provide multipath gain to the PTx in return. Such an approach is useful for almost all vote-based CMs, such as the Practical Byzantine Fault-tolerant (PBFT)-like and the RAFT-like CMs. This paper proposes symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC) by transforming 6 PBFT-like and 4 RAFT-like state-of-the-art (SOTA) CMs to demonstrate universality. These new CMs will benefit from mutualistic transmission relationships in SR, making full use of the limited spectrum resources in WBN.

Many recent works solve this problem based on the set-enumeration (SE) tree, which sequentially traverses vertices to generate the enumeration tree nodes representing distinct bicliques, then checks whether these bicliques are maximal or not. However, existing MBE algorithms only expand bicliques with untraversed vertices to ensure distinction, which often necessitate extensive node checks to eliminate non-maximal bicliques, resulting in significant computational overhead during the enumeration process. To address this issue, we propose an aggressive set-enumeration (ASE) tree that aggressively expands all bicliques to their maximal form, thus avoiding costly node checks on non-maximal bicliques. This aggressive enumeration may produce multiple duplicate maximal bicliques, but we efficiently eliminate these duplicates by lever-aging the connection between parent and child nodes and conducting low-cost node checking. Additionally, we introduce an aggressive merge-based pruning (AMP) approach that aggressively merges vertices sharing the same local neighbors. This helps prune numerous duplicate node generations caused by subsets of merged vertices. We integrate the AMP approach into the ASE tree, and present the Aggressive Maximal Biclique Enumeration Algorithm (AMBEA).

Many approaches to improving blockchain scalability often result in diminished security or compromise the decentralized nature of the system. Inspired by network science, especially the epidemic model, we try to solve this problem by mapping the propagation of transactions and blocks as two interacting epidemics, called the CoSIS model. We extend the transaction propagation process to increase the efficiency of block propagation, which reduces the number of unknown transactions. The reduction of the block propagation latency ultimately increases the blockchain throughput. The theory of complex networks is employed to offer an optimal boundary condition. Finally, the node scores are stored in the chain, so that it also provides a new incentive approach. Our experiments show that CoSIS accelerates blocks!/ propagation and TPS is raised by 20% ~ 33% on average.

These principles promote transparency, accountability, and independent validation of FL processes. Incorporating auditability and verifiability is imperative for building trust and ensuring the robustness of FL methodologies. Typical FL architectures rely on a trustworthy central authority to manage the FL process. However, reliance on a central authority could become a single point of failure, making it an attractive target for cyber-attacks and insider frauds. Moreover, the central entity lacks auditability and verifiability, which undermines the privacy and security that FL aims to ensure. This article proposes an auditable and verifiable decentralized FL (DFL) framework. We first develop a smart-contract-based monitoring system for DFL participants. This monitoring system is then deployed to each DFL participant and executed when the local model training is initiated. The monitoring system records necessary information during the local training process for auditing purposes. Afterward, each DFL participant sends the local model and monitoring system to the respective blockchain node. The blockchain nodes representing each DFL participant exchange the local models and use the monitoring system to validate each local model. To ensure an auditable and verifiable decentralized aggregation procedure, we record the aggregation steps taken by each blockchain node in the aggregation contract. Following the aggregation phase, each blockchain node applies a multisignature scheme to the aggregated model, producing a globally verifiable model. Based on the signed global model and the aggregation contract, each blockchain node implements a consensus protocol to store the validated global model in tamper-proof storage. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted a series of experiments with different machine learning architectures and datasets, including CIFAR-10, F-MNIST, and MedMNIST. The experimental results indicate a slight increase in time consumption compared with the state-of-the-art, serving as a tradeoff to ensure auditability and verifiability.

For this problem, a granular-computing-based data-sharing decision-making (GrC-DSDM) method is proposed. In the GrC-DSDM method, a fuzzy proximity relationship is used to describe the familiarity between MSMEs in the same MC, and MC familiarity is obtained based on the granular space derived from the fuzzy proximity relation. A fuzzy preference relation is used to representMSMEs\u2019 preferences for all metadata related to the order, and a group decision-making method is applied to calculate the preference values for all metadata.

With the development of quantum computers, blockchains traditionally used for traceability struggle to guarantee the authenticity of data. Furthermore, only chained blocks have been used in previous traceability systems, which has resulted in a full backup for each business unit in the supply chain, wasting storage resources significantly. Another problem is that there are differences in the data structure and consensus mechanisms of each unit, which makes maintenance difficult. To address these problems, it is encouraging to create a new blockchain with high scalability and resistance to quantum attacks. This paper innovatively proposes a quantum hybrid blockchain-based data authenticity framework (QHB-DA) with five layers, which not only accomplishes traceability, but also has assurance that data can withstand verification. In QHB-DA, blockchain utilizes a combination of DAG and chained structures to reduce data redundancy, in which quantum hashes are performed to connect blocks. Algorithms ED-QKD and D2B-QSC are designed to keep the information from being leaked during transmission and format conversion.

Existing options contract protocols have the following two weaknesses: (i) The buyer have to lock his asset during the contract's lifespan, incurring heavy opportunity costs; (ii) Turing-completed smart contract (TCSC)/hash time lock contract (HTLC) is required to exchange assets, which restricts applicability as TCSC/HTLC is supported by a limited number of blockchains.

By classifying the users into dynamic energy consumption classes to reward energy efficiency and penalize excessive use, users can modify their behavior to pass to a less expensive and more virtuous consumption class. To this aim, a blockchain platform determines the rewards and penalties and, by a K-means clustering algorithm, categorizes users into respective groups. Then, a Class Follower Problem is formulated and solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory network as a predictive model. If the users follow the suggestions proposed by the controller, i.e., the thermostat set-points and the time intervals in which the HVAC system must be switched off or on, the users can be located in a more virtuous consumption class. A case study conducted within an energy district in Bari (Italy) shows how the proposed architectural framework tuned thermal regulation in intelligent buildings while concurrently achieving energy optimization. Note to Practitioners \u2014This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently managing HVAC systems in smart districts through a novel blockchain-based framework and an optimization strategy solved by an MPC approach. The objective is to incentivize users to optimize their energy consumption by introducing dynamic Consumption Classes that reward energy efficiency and penalize inefficient utilization. For practitioners, this strategy translates to a granular level of energy management that not only adapts to individual behaviors but also aligns with broader sustainability goals. Integrating the blockchain platform ensures a transparent and secure method for managing and recording energy usage. At the same time, adopting MPC with Long Short-Term Memory Networks offers accurate forecasts and adjustments to enhance system responsiveness.

Specifically, the proposed scheme utilizes blockchain technology and the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to securely and efficiently store and share task information in a fully decentralized manner. Vehicle users anonymously participate in tasks within VANETs using pseudonym information generated during registration with a trusted authority (TA). Additionally, by employing zk-SNARK to generate zero-knowledge proofs, the validity and integrity of task information can be verified without revealing any private information.

However, security issues caused by deliberate attacks in distributed systems and efficiency issues induced by heterogeneous computing consumption in resource-limited systems need to be urgently addressed in BFL. To address these issues, we propose a Decentralized Reputation Management (DRM) mechanism for a Trustworthy BFL (T-BFL) network, that explores, stores, and utilizes the endogenous reputation of distributed nodes to promote system security and efficiency. The proposed DRM includes three core modules, i.e., decentralized reputation evaluation, reputation-based model aggregation, and reputation-based blockchain consensus. Specifically, in the off-chain phase of T-BFL, the reputation value of each node is evaluated based on model quality, which other peer nodes can verify. This reputation value further determines the weight of global aggregation at each node. In the on-chain phase, the reputation of each node serves as the stake to dynamically adjust its consensus difficulty. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence rate of the T-BFL network under the poisoning attack, and dynamically optimize the energy allocation of local training, consensus, and communications by minimizing the upper bound of the global loss function. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of T-BFL on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Cifar-10 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with traditional BFL, T-BFL can achieve up to 56.12% accuracy improvement and 8.6\u00d7 acceleration for reaching the target learning accuracy under the poisoning attack.", "Date of Publication": "16 October 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720160/", "Published In": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "Title": "Trustworthy Blockchain-Assisted Federated Learning: Decentralized Reputation Management and Performance Optimization"}, {"_id": "672ed3a514cae7071f1da861", "DOI": "10.1109/TR.2024.3474710", "Abstract": "Aviation Internet of Things (AIoT) data sharing can create tremendous value for participants.

Recently, it finds applications in blockchain, where several users want to jointly authorize a payment through a multi-signature.

Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is desired that the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature are both as short as possible. In this paper, we find a compiler that converts a kind of identification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so that both the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature have a size independent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The advantage of our result is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly secure two-party problem. We realize our compiler with two ID schemes.

Blockchain technology enables privacy preservation for medical data through encryption. However, conventional data encryption hampers data analysis and sharing, and decrypted data still carries the risk of leakage. Homomorphic encryption is a technique that allows computation directly on encrypted data without decryption, thus reducing the risk of data leakage during sharing. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preservation and sharing scheme for healthcare IoT data. First, we use an improved homomorphic encryption technique to encrypt and process electronic health records (EHRs), optimizing the modular exponentiation process with a fast exponentiation algorithm, enabling users to efficiently perform data computation and analysis while keeping the data encrypted. Second, we employ symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) to encrypt homomorphic keys and user identity information, and use a Bloom filter as the mapping structure between data keywords and unique identifiers. This approach enhances search efficiency while preserving data privacy, allowing for secure search and analysis on ciphertext.

Observing that the blockchain technique has great potential to improve security, efficiency and transparency of data trading, we present a blockchain-based fair data trading scheme, called BFFDT, which allows the data seller trade its data in part with an interested purchaser through a smart contract for revenue.

However, the surge in transactions has led to heightened relations between nodes in the system, reflecting the volume of transactions between them. The increase in related nodes engaging in identical transactions across diverse shards leads to substantial cross-shard transactions, contributing to communication delays and impeding enhancements in throughput. Current methods typically employ greedy or heuristic approaches to organize nodes into shards, resulting in marginal reductions in the total relation between related nodes in different shards (i.e., the number of cross-shard transactions), while causing shard imbalance. Hence, there is a crucial need for periodic shard reorganization based on node relations to minimize the total relation between related nodes across different shards while ensuring shard balance.

Consequently, the discriminative power of the learnt target features is weak. To address this issue, we propose a novel RGB-T tracker (called TGTrack) that designs a Top-down Cross-modal Guidance mechanism to learn target features in two stages. In the first stage, our TGTrack effectively generates top-down cross-modal guidance signals with multi-modal encoders-decoders and prior vectors. In the second stage, these signals are transmitted and integrated to improve the discriminative power of our target features by the attention layers of the cross-modal encoders.

However, these methods overlook instability of modal validity in real-world scenarios. This limits the model\u2019s ability to understand the correlation between modalities, thereby hindering the model\u2019s ability to fully leverage the synergistic effects of RGB and TIR. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RGB-T tracking model named MCTrack, from the perspective of leveraging correlation among modalities. First, during the feature extraction stage, we design a novel module based on channel matching modeling to construct bidirectional channel context information flow for two modalities. By leveraging information flow, specific modalities correlation information can be transmitted to two modes, augmenting the correlation between the two modes adaptively. Subsequently, after the feature extraction network, the features of each modality are decoded and transformed to generate more correlated feature representations. During this stage, we extract distinctive and collective features by leveraging the correlation among modalities. Then fusing these features and generated search region features specifically for localization. This aids the model in comprehending the correlation between RGB and TIR under complex scenarios, thereby enhancing its ability to capture and utilize key features.

However, this paradigm may degrade the tracking performance due to inaccurate language descriptions and lacks further modal interaction. To address these issues, we propose a one-stream vision-language model called One-stream Stepwise Decreasing for Vision-Language Tracking (OSDT). Specifically, we first encode the language description using a language encoder. The obtained language features are then combined with visual images and entered jointly into a visual encoder, in which the encoder\u2019s self-attention mechanism is utilized to facilitate more interactions between language and visual features.

To ensure privacy, differential privacy is applied in FL by clipping and adding noise to local gradients (i.e., Local Differential Privacy (LDP)) or the global model update (i.e., Central Differential Privacy (CDP)). However, the effectiveness of DP in defending GLAs needs to be thoroughly investigated since some works briefly verify that DP can guard FL against GLAs while others question its defense capability. In this paper, we empirically evaluate CDP and LDP on the resistance of GLAs, and pay close attention to the trade-offs between privacy and utility in FL. Our findings reveal that 1) existing GLAs can be defended by CDP using a per-layer clipping strategy and LDP with a reasonable privacy guarantee; 2) both CDP and LDP ensure the trade-off between privacy and utility in training shallow model, but cannot guarantee this trade-off in deeper model training (e.g., ResNets). Triggered by the crucial role of clipping operation for DP, we propose an improved attack that incorporates the clipping operation into existing GLAs without requiring additional information. The experimental results show our attack can destruct the protection of CDP and weaken the effectiveness of LDP.

Most existing fairness-aware incentive mechanisms distribute rewards to FL clients by quantifying their contributions to the performance of the global model. Essentially, these mechanisms pursue contribution fairness, namely a constant contribution-reward ratio across FL clients, with an implicit assumption that clients would be satisfied with the contribution fairness. However, research in social psychology has confirmed that this assumption may not hold in many real-world scenarios. According to equity theory proposed by Adams, an individual's assessment and perception of receiving fair treatment significantly depend on the input-outcome ratio, where outcome simply refers to the rewards, while input is far more complex because it involves a bunch of subtle factors such as enthusiasm, experience and tolerance as well as the estimated contributions. Inspired by Adams' equity theory, in this work, we expand the notion of contribution fairness to input fairness and propose a new fairness-aware incentive mechanism named FairReward that distributes rewards under the joint consideration of self-reported inputs and computed contributions. FairReward employs a reputation mechanism to enhance the credibility of self-reported inputs and leverages blockchains to eliminate the need of a trusted FL server and monetarily incentivize/penalize clients.

Currently, federated learning algorithms assume that all participants are trustworthy and their systems are secure. However, the following problems arise in real-world scenarios: (1) Malicious clients disrupt federated learning through model poisoning and data poisoning attacks. Although some research has proposed secure aggregation methods to solve this problem, most methods have limitations. (2) Due to the variance in data quality and computational resources among participants, rewards cannot be distributed equally. Some clients also exhibit free-rider behavior, seeking to cheat the reward system and manipulate global models. Evaluating client contribution and distributing rewards also present challenges.\nTo address these challenges, we design a trustworthy federated framework to ensure secure computing throughout the federated task process.

To address these issues, we propose a unified spatio-temporal cues learning framework (named USCLTrack) that comprehensively mines the variation patterns of targets between consecutive frames in complex video streams. Specifically, USCLTrack firstly aggregates motion and appearance cues into shared queries to provide the bridge of interaction between both cues. Then, it directly generates object locations on the condition of these shared queries in an autoregressive manner, unifying different cues to guide future inferences. To effectively learn multiple spatio-temporal cues aggregated in the shared queries, we develop a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. This mechanism integrates motion cues with appearance cues according to the time steps for ensuring temporal consistency. Moreover, it concurrently captures motion trends and appearance changes to facilitate the understanding of the target objects. Extensive experiments on eight popular tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed USCLTrack.", "Date of Publication": "25 October 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735223/", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "Title": "Unifying Motion and Appearance Cues for Visual Tracking via Shared Queries"}, {"_id": "672ed3b114cae7071f1daf50", "DOI": "10.1109/TMC.2024.3447907", "Abstract": "Among the foremost contributors to compromised driving safety is the abrupt emergence of obstacles or pedestrians within drivers' non-line-of-sight regions.

This study utilizes the reinforcement learning (RL) method to obtain supervisory policies for opacity enforcement in the case when the automaton model of the system is unavailable. The state space of the environment in the RL is dynamically generated through system simulation. Actions are defined according to the control patterns of the SCT. A reward function is proposed to evaluate whether the secret is exposed or not. Then, a sequence of state-action-reward chains are obtained as system simulation goes on. The frameworks of Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms are adopted to implement the proposed approach. The goal of the training is to maximize the total accumulative reward by optimizing the action selection in the learning process. Then, an optimal supervisory policy is obtained when the training process converges. Experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contributions are two aspects. Firstly, a supervisor for opacity enforcement is learned by RL training without an explicit formal model of the system. Secondly, the ability of the proposed method in computing supervisory policies without formal models addresses a significant gap in the literature and offers a new direction for research in opacity enforcement in discrete event systems. Note to Practitioners \u2014Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) supplies an effective way to synthesize supervisors, which traditionally handles tasks with explicit system models for current-state opacity enforcement by restricting behavior of systems. However, formal models of systems are often confidential or otherwise unavailable. This paper presents a method for supervisor synthesis via reinforcement learning in the case of lacking formal models of systems. The proposed method leverages the characteristics of control patterns in SCT and optimizes the action selection in the training process through a reward mechanism that evaluates the secrecy of states. The approach can be applied to model-free RL frameworks such as Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms. The training is performed as the system simulation goes on. When the training process converges, the optimal policy can be used to enforce opacity for the system. However, Q-table is used to save the Q-value in both Q-learning and SARSA algorithms. In the worst case, the size of the Q-table grows exponentially with the number of states and controllable events increasing. This can lead to memory exhaustion when the system\u2019s scale is large.

Considering that, although the on-chain data is tamper-proof, the existing blockchain technology lacks the means to verify the authenticity of the source data before it is uploaded to the chain, a new blockchain consensus mechanism is designed. Wherein five consensus guidelines ensure that only real trust parameters can be written on the chain. In this way, malicious terminals can be identified by consensus screening and trust calculation, thereby taking control measures. Moreover, to avoid redundant hash operations during the trust parameter upload process, Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) is introduced to optimize the block structure.

However, blockchain-enabled FL (BFL) still faces several challenges. The primary and most significant issue arises from its essential but slow validation procedure, which selects high-quality local models by recruiting distributed validators. The second issue stems from its incentive mechanism under the transparent nature of blockchain, increasing the risk of privacy breaches regarding workers' cost information. The final challenge involves data eavesdropping from shared local models. To address these significant obstacles, this paper proposes a Blockchain-enabled Incentivized and Secure Federated Learning (BIT-FL) framework. BIT-FL leverages a novel loop-based sharded consensus algorithm to accelerate the validation procedure, ensuring the same security as non-sharded consensus protocols. It consistently outputs the correct local model selection when the fraction of adversaries among validators is less than\n1/2\nwith synchronous communication. Furthermore, BIT-FL integrates a randomized incentive procedure, attracting more participants while guaranteeing the privacy of their cost information through meticulous worker selection probability design. Finally, by adding artificial Gaussian noise to local models, it ensures the privacy of trainers' local models. With the careful design of Gaussian noise, the excess empirical risk of BIT-FL is upper-bounded by\nO(\nln\nn\nmin\nn\n3/2\nmin\n+\nlnn\nn\n)\n, where\nn\nrepresents the size of the union dataset, and\nn\nmin\nrepresents the size of the smallest dataset.

In a dynamic wireless network, drones often share data with multiple users, which is vulnerable to various security threats, e.g., eavesdropping, privacy leakage, and impersonation. Ensuring secure sharing of drone operation data is a critical issue. Existing schemes employ blockchain to ensure accountability in untrusted IoD contexts. However, drones perform excessive operations, e.g., consensus and homomorphic encryption, leading to impractical drone computation overhead. Furthermore, these existing schemes perform point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data sharing by using identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) as it has stateless receiver property, i.e., drones can directly establish sharing groups based on the receiver identities. However, these IBBE-based schemes need to preset the sharing group capacity, reducing sharing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic IoD networks.

Targeting privacy leakage of cross-device FL in CIoT, various privacy-preserving FL schemes have been proposed. Regrettably, existing schemes still face three significant challenges: 1) Current privacy-preserving strategies struggle to fully defend against Byzantine attacks in FL without compromising data privacy; 2) Most privacy-preserving techniques (e.g. secret sharing) in FL result in substantial computation and communication overhead; 3) The non-colluding dual-server setting limits the applicability of FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Byzantine-robust hierarchical federated learning scheme, named BHFL. This scheme not only effectively defends against Byzantine attacks while safeguarding user privacy but also avoids the need for a dual-server architecture. Simultaneously, the hierarchical aggregation structure can effectively train non-IID cross-device data while maintaining high communication efficiency.

Traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems rely on centralized Certificate Authorities (CAs) to validate users and manage public keys, but this centralization creates a single point of failure. If a CA is compromised, it can register fake public keys or alter legitimate ones, leading to counterfeit certificates. While blockchain-based approaches decentralize CA authority across multiple entities, these solutions are largely reactive, focusing on certificate issuance and relying on user signatures for validation. They lack a robust mechanism to authenticate and authorize requests before certificate issuance, a crucial step typically managed by Registration Authorities (RA) in CA-based PKI systems. To address this gap, we introduce PKChain, a novel compromise-tolerant and verifiable public key management system built on blockchain. PKChain addresses two key challenges: it uses a Threshold Block Validation (TBV) scheme for key request validation, where validators partially validate requests and collaborate for full validation. Once a request gains majority approval, it advances to the Aggregated Commitment Signature (ACS) scheme, where validators collectively issue certificates. By requiring majority approval in the TBV stage before moving to certificate issuance, PKChain ensures proactive security throughout the process. To achieve consensus on validation and issuance, we propose a threshold cryptography-based consensus mechanism called the practical Byzantine Compromise-tolerant and Verifiable (pBCTV) consensus model, integrating TBV and ACS schemes with the practical Byzantine Fault-tolerance (pBFT) protocol.

However, with the increase of privacy threats and malicious activities, three major challenges are emerging: securing privacy, alleviating straggler problems, and mitigating Byzantine attacks. Although recent studies explore coded computing for privacy and straggler problems, as well as Byzantine-robust aggregation for poisoning attacks, they are not well-designed against both threats simultaneously. To tackle these obstacles and achieve an efficient Byzantine-robust and straggler-resilient distributed learning framework, in this article, we present Byzantine-robust and cost-effective distributed machine learning (BCML), a codesign of coded computing and Byzantine-robust aggregation. To balance the Byzantine resilience and efficiency, we design a cosine-similarity-based Byzantine-robust aggregation method tailored for coded computing to filter out malicious gradients efficiently in real time. Furthermore, trust scores derived from similarity are published to the blockchain for the reliability and traceability of social users. Experimental results show that our BCML can tolerate Byzantine attacks without compromising convergence accuracy with lower time consumption, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it is 6x faster than the uncoded approach and 2x faster than the Lagrange coded computing (LCC) approach.

Compared to symbolic execution and pattern-matching methods, fuzz testing method can achieve higher accuracy and are better suitable for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities. However, existing fuzz testing tools often spend a long time exploring states with little pruning, and most of them adopt the reentrancy vulnerability oracle used by static analysis tools, which ignores whether the vulnerability can be exploited to compromise the access control, mutex, or time locks. To address these issues, we propose EvoFuzzer, an evolutionary fuzzer that focuses on the detection of reentrancy vulnerabilities.

Due to the openness of Web 3.0, individuals can freely join or leave training and adjust data size, creating population uncertainty and making it difficult to design incentive mechanisms. Therefore, we propose a Poisson game-based FL incentive mechanism that motivates participants to contribute more data and computing power, considering the variability of data size and computing power requirements, and provides a feasible solution to the uncertainty of the number of participants using a Poisson game model.

Traditional consensus solutions exhibit slow processing speed and response time, resulting in poor performance. To address this issue, several consensus protocols have been proposed. One such popular protocol is HotStuff, a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus (BFT) that achieves high throughput at the cost of latency. However, its throughput suffers from a proportional decrease with the increase in latency, posing a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a new protocol called Dolphin that builds upon HotStuff. It operates in a partially synchronous network with n\nreplicas, up to f\nbyzantine faults, where n \\ge 3f+1\n, and achieves higher throughput in high-latency environments by leveraging non-blocking concurrent block generation. Specifically, we formalize our strategy as a generic Asynchronization Procedure Patch and prove that it does not affect the execution process of the original protocol. Theoretical analysis validates that Dolphin preserves the safety, liveness, and responsiveness properties while enhancing the throughput. The evaluation demonstrates that Dolphin typically achieves more than 10x higher throughput in Wide Area Network (WAN) environments with lower latency compared to HotStuff and its variants, and exhibits similar bandwidth utilization to DAG-based protocols such as Narwhal.", "Date of Publication": "13 May 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529599/", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing", "Title": "Dolphin: Efficient Non-Blocking Consensus via Concurrent Block Generation"}, {"_id": "672ed3bc14cae7071f1db682", "DOI": "10.1109/TDSC.2024.3390761", "Abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data.

This poses a risk of unauthorized model distribution or resale by the malicious client, compromising the intellectual property rights of the FL group. To deter such misbehavior, it is essential to establish a mechanism for verifying the ownership of the model and as well tracing its origin to the leaker among the FL participants. In this paper, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that provides both ownership verification and traceability. FedTracker adopts a bi-level protection scheme consisting of global watermark mechanism and local fingerprint mechanism. The former authenticates the ownership of the global model, while the latter identifies which client the model is derived from. FedTracker leverages Continual Learning (CL) principles to embed the watermark in a way that preserves the utility of the FL model on both primitive task and watermark task. FedTracker also devises a novel metric to better discriminate different fingerprints.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism for a federated learning paradigm, namely TiFedCrowd, which mitigates the risk of privacy breaches for crowd workers and obtains high-quality crowdsourcing data and learning models at the minimum cost. TiFedCrowd allows clients to keep privacy-related data locally, just needing to upload trained models (parameters) to the server. The server then aggregates local models into a global model. TiFedCrowd models the federated crowdsourcing process as a two-stage Stackelberg game and motivates more workers to complete tasks with high quality and efficiency. It also provides a time control mechanism to manage the quality of the submitted outcomes, the range of data freshness, and the waiting time. TiFedCrowd requires the client to complete the federated crowdsourcing task within a specified time interval while globally maximizing the utility of both clients and the server by solving the Nash equilibrium. We also extended TiFedCrowd to the multiple heterogeneous federated crowdsourcing scenario.

As people begin to reevaluate traditional notions of monetary ownership, cryptocurrencies will be poised to play an even more critical role in the future. However, the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies has been hampered by several challenges, including volatility and scalability. The concepts of Stablecoin and Payment Channel Network (PCN) are promising proposals for these problems, providing effective individual solutions. While PCN addresses the scalability issue of cryptocurrencies, its transaction reliability is not always up to par for widespread use. Similarly, the increasing centralisation of Stablecoins contradicts the fundamental principle of introducing cryptocurrencies. This paper introduces a decentralised model that integrates both approaches to establish a monetary system while mitigating their inherent drawbacks. It encompasses a subsidised node and stablecoin designs for PCN with a dedicated and incentivised layer of entities to facilitate reliable PCN transactions and contribute to stabilising the underlying currency of PCN. It introduces an integrated network-backed stablecoin for PCN, achieving both stability and scalability concurrently. Also, approximately half of the initial funding required to establish payment channels is derived from external sources, ensuring a guaranteed return on investment within an under-collateralised and decentralised environment. Our system has been substantiated through game theory and simulations, demonstrating its capacity to stabilise the coin's value and effectively fulfil the expected functionalities of a currency. Empirical tests have confirmed its retention of PCN's scalability, even with additional steps integrated to implement the proposed protocol. We also highlight its resilience to potential attacks.

However, the vast number of transactions on the platform has also brought a number of illegal activities, such as phishing scams, which have caused significant damage to the Ethereum ecosystem. Due to anonymity of the blockchain, it is difficult for detectors to extract features that can be directly applied to phishing scams detection. Existing studies mainly model Ethereum transaction records as a network and mine key information from them to identify phishing addresses. However, these methods usually employ traditional feature engineering or network embedding, ignoring the fine-grained features in the transaction network. In addition, since the original network is too large to make learning difficult, existing work usually uses random walk to sample a part of nodes for training, thus ignoring the multiplicity of the network. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a three-stream feature fusion (TSFF) approach to enhance the feature representation of nodes. Specifically, we construct node states to guide random walk sampling, and manually extracted 8-dimensional features from the resulting dataset as basic features. Temporal features are jointly learned through long short-term memory network and Contrastive Learning. We combine residual blocks and Graph Convolutional Network to extract fine-grained structural features from transactional networks.

To support CAS applications such as AI-driven decision-making and blockchain-based smart data management platform, data and message exchange/dissemination is a fundamental element. The distributed message broadcast and forward protocols in CAS, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), can suffer from significant message loss and uncertain transmission delay, and faulty nodes might disseminate fake messages to confuse the network. Therefore, the consensus mechanism is essential in CAS with distributed structure to guaranteed correct nodes agree on the same parameter and reach consistency. However, due to the wireless nature of CAS, traditional consensus cannot be directly deployed. In addition, with the development of intelligence in machines, traditional consensus might be inefficient for future CAS. This article reviews several existing consensus mechanisms, including average/maximum/minimum estimation consensus mechanisms that apply on quantity, Byzantine fault tolerance consensus for request, state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain, as well as their implementations in CAS.

To safeguard the privacy of participants, decentralized anonymous payment (DAP) systems such as ZCash and Zether have emerged.

To address this issue, we propose the Walsh-DAP (WDAP) scheme, an efficient and generic regulation scheme for decentralized anonymous payments that strikes a balance between regulation and privacy preservation. Our scheme introduces two regulation policies: first, users who have exceeded their spending limits within a certain period will be identified during the regulation process; second, the supervisor possesses the capability to trace any anonymous transaction. To implement regulation effectively, we have designed an innovative commitment scheme, Walsh commitment, which leverages the orthogonal properties of Walsh codes to achieve the features of aggregatability and extractability. The supervisor in WDAP only needs to deal with the aggregation result of the Walsh commitments instead of the huge amount of raw transactions information, which greatly increases the efficiency.

As one of the popular policies, the cap-and-trade policy provides carbon emission quotas for power generation companies. Each company must carefully determine its energy production based on the carbon emission quota and renewable uncertainty. This paper analyzes the cooperation among different power generation companies using the coalitional game theory. Power generation companies can form a union to share the total carbon emission quotas to maximize their total profit. We show the optimality of the grand coalition by proving that the profit function is superadditive. This result highlights the benefits of cooperation. Besides, we propose a profit allocation mechanism that allocates the total profit to different power generation companies. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed profit allocation mechanism is in the core of the coalitional game such that no group of power generation companies has any incentives to leave the grand coalition.

However, challenges such as unpredictable wireless conditions, resource constraints, and task redundancy have intertwined impacts on the overall performance of edge video streaming systems (EVS). Therefore, it is essential to have an integrated framework that addresses resource management, computational offloading, and video task preprocessing. Existing optimization strategies often neglect the simultaneous management of computational offloading, resource allocation, and video task preprocessing, leading to a suboptimal system utility. Moreover, they struggle to handle high-dimensional decision variables. On the other hand, learning-based adaptive schemes fall short in integrating distributed decisions and ensuring the scalability of wireless devices. Additionally, current approaches lack adaptive incentives. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel framework called AIRA, which is based on improved multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and smart contracts. AIRA manages resources, video compression, and adaptive incentives in a distributed manner. It consists of a MARL-driven cooperative learning algorithm (CLA) and a smart contract-guided adaptive incentive mechanism. Leveraging an actorcritic structure, the CLA enables wireless devices to master strategies for resource allocation, video task compression, and offloading, utilizing historical data. Notably, the CLA incorporates an attention mechanism to select pivotal tuples from the observationaction pairings among different agents, ensuring improved scalability and computational prowess.

It has experienced explosive growth, reaching a multibillion-dollar market. Establishing transparency is essential for constructing a trusted, fair, and regulation-compliant financial collaboration model. Meanwhile, confidentiality must be maintained to protect the sensitive financial information of individual lenders. Multi-party computation (MPC) can protect the input privacy of lenders, but it cannot safeguard the sensitive information revealed by the fund flow itself. To address these challenges, we propose a new collaborative financial ledger for online syndicated lending.

However, the paradigm of P2P faces various challenges ranging from network scalability and reliability to the frequent topology changes of vehicular environments and weak resource management. As a result, a set of problems could be generated, such as data inconsistency and unreliability, weak lookup success rate, and low end-to-end delay, especially when requesting data. To address all these issues, we propose an innovative solution that leverages an aerial backbone consisting of a connected group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This system efficiently covers the integrality of the terrestrial vehicular environment while ensuring efficient data sharing and distribution towards it, thus playing the role of an aerial P2P overlay. The establishment of the aerial backbone takes into account two factors: (i) the connectivity degree among UAVs and (ii) their remaining energy levels. To ensure that these two factors are constantly verified and maintain permanent data availability for the vehicular environment, a Deep Q Network (DQN) method is adopted to optimize the movements of UAVs according to the terrestrial environment dynamics.

After the URL is vectorized, it is input into the two-layer classification network proposed in this paper to classify the website. This classifier consists of an upstream task Bert layer and a downstream task CNN layer. It is possible to simultaneously learn the comprehensive representation information and local feature information of URLs, effectively avoiding overfitting problems and improving the ability to identify phishing websites.

Specifically, attribute-incomplete indicates that a portion of the attribute vectors of all nodes are incomplete, while attribute-missing indicates that all attribute vectors of partial nodes are missing. Although various graph imputation methods have been proposed, none of them is custom-designed for a common situation where both types of graph absence exist simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a novel graph imputation network termed revisiting initializing then refining (RITR), where both attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing samples are completed under the guidance of a novel initializing-then-refining imputation criterion. Specifically, to complete attribute-incomplete samples, we first initialize the incomplete attributes using Gaussian noise before network learning, and then introduce a structure-attribute consistency constraint to refine incomplete values by approximating a structure-attribute correlation matrix to a high-order structure matrix. To complete attribute-missing samples, we first adopt structure embeddings of attribute-missing samples as the embedding initialization, and then refine these initial values by adaptively aggregating the reliable information of attribute-incomplete samples according to a dynamic affinity structure.

Physical layer security (PLS) has received a growing interest from the research community in recent years for its ability to safeguard data confidentiality without relying on key distribution or encryption/decryption, and for its latency advantage over bit-level cryptographic techniques. However, the evolution towards the fifth generation (5G) technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless communication networks. Among the potential key-enabling technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat dynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be adopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both radio frequency (RF) and optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. It is worth noting that the configuration of RIS in RF communications is different from the one in optical systems at many levels (e.g., RIS materials, signal characteristics, and functionalities). This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the information-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article first discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed by their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some optimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system model, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a comprehensive performance analysis. Given that the computational complexity of future communication systems that adopt RIS-assisted PLS is likely to increase rapidly as the number of interactions between the users and infrastructure grows, machine learning (ML) is seen as a promising approach to address this complexity issue while sustaining or improving the network performance.

So that a Double-layer Multi-scale Star-graph (DMS) structure is proposed to detect robust correspondences using two different types of multi-scale star-graphs. The first-layer Multi-scale Neighbor Feature Star-graphs (MNFS) takes each point as the center and its multi-scale nearest neighbors as the leaves. The MNFS enables to establish the initial correspondence candidate set between the two point clouds based on multi-scale neighborhood topology and feature similarity. Subsequently, each pair of corresponding points find their nearest neighbors within the correspondence sets to construct a Multi-scale Matching Star-graphs (MMS) on each side, so the mutual correspondence relationships between the MMS vertices are identified. These identified mutual correspondences are treated as vertices to construct the Multi-scale Correspondence Star-graphs (MCS), that indicate the relationships among the correspondences.

Experimental results on a realistic Ethereum dataset demonstrate that proposed RiskProp newly discovered 63% of the Top 150 high-risk accounts as suspicious. The superior performance of risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the effectiveness of our rating method (85.63% accuracy).", "Date of Publication": "10 October 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10713353/", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing", "Title": "RiskProp: Account Risk Rating on Ethereum via De-anonymous Score and Network Propagation"}, {"_id": "672ed3cb14cae7071f1dbf4a", "DOI": "10.1109/TNET.2024.3461872", "Abstract": "With the increasing demand for blockchain technology in various industry sectors, there has been a growing interest in the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus that is the backbone of most of these blockchains. However, many state-of-the-art algorithms that require reliable connections can only offer limited throughput in wide-area networks (WANs), where participants are connected over long distances and may experience unpredictable network failures. The partially-connected BFTs are designed for unreliable and highly dynamic networks yet impose exponential communication complexity. This paper proposes Stable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), a BFT communication abstraction that can sustain high throughput and low latency in WAN. SBFT separates the leader from consensus in pipelined BFT consensus and uses an adaptive consensus mechanism to resist dynamic faulty links, maintaining consensus efficiency when network connectivity is high while adapting to dynamic networks with low connectivity. We implemented a prototype of SBFT and tested it on the WAN. The results demonstrate that SBFT has a throughput similar to HotStuff in a fault-free environment but can reduce about 80% of consensus latency. Besides, SBFT retains 40% of the original throughput when the link failure probability is 0.4\n, while the baseline HotStuff retains less than 40% when the link failure probability is only 0.1\n.", "Date of Publication": "26 September 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695774/", "Published In": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking", "Title": "Stable Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Wide Area Networks With Unreliable Links"}, {"_id": "672ed3cb14cae7071f1dbf5c", "DOI": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3425841", "Abstract": "Addressing challenges such as centralization, data tampering, and information silos within traditional supply chain transparency frameworks, we leverage the decentralized, immutable, and traceable attributes of blockchain technology. Given the multitude of participating nodes and the extensive volume of tracking data in Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) supply chains, we initially propose a master-slave multi-chain data storage model tailored for MaaS supply chain transparency. Building upon this, to enhance blockchain performance in this context and address the issues of high communication overhead, low consensus efficiency, and the absence of dynamic mechanisms inherent in the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) method, we introduce the Service Quality Scoring Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SQS-PBFT) method. By incorporating the service quality scoring model for optimal master node selection, we aim to improve consensus efficiency; through the node tiering mechanism and consensus protocol optimization, we reduce communication costs; and by establishing the dynamic node mechanism for flexible node entry and exit, we enhance system flexibility. Experiments demonstrate that with an increasing number of nodes, the proposed SQS-PBFT method results in about 29.47% lower communication overhead, about 25.11% higher throughput, about 19.98% reduced latency, and about 36.15% reduced malicious behavior, thus offering improved consensus efficiency and serving as a reference for MaaS supply chain transparency.", "Date of Publication": "10 July 2024", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591969/", "Published In": "IEEE Access", "Title": "Enhancing Manufacturing-as-a-Service Supply Chain Transparency with Master-Slave Multi-Chain and Service Quality Scoring Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance"}, {"_id": "672ed3cb14cae7071f1dbf7a", "DOI": "10.1109/TDSC.2024.3357521", "Abstract": "Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Consensus protocols with trusted hardware assistance have been extensively explored for their improved resilience to tolerate more faulty processes.

RedBelly is assumed to be the first blockchain network whose consensus is based on a truly leaderless BFT algorithm. This paper proposes a trusted hardware-assisted leaderless BFT consensus protocol by offering a hybrid solution for the set BFT problem defined in the RedBelly blockchain. Drawing on previous studies, we present two crucial trusted services: the counter and the collector. Based on these two services, we introduce two primitives to formulate our leaderless BFT protocol: a hybrid verified broadcast (VRB) protocol and a hybrid binary agreement. The hybrid VRB protocol enhances the hybrid reliable broadcast protocol by integrating a verification function. This addition ensures that a broadcast message is verified not only for authentication but also for the correctness of its content. Our hybrid BFT consensus is integrated with these broadcast protocols to deliver binary decisions on all proposals.

As a popular decision fusion technique (DFT), the majority voting function (MVF) finds applications in resolving conflicts, where several independent voters report their opinions on a classification problem. Despite its importance and its various applications in ensemble learning, data crowdsourcing, remote sensing, and data oracles for blockchains, the accuracy of the MVF for the general multiclass classification problem has remained unknown. In this article, we derive a new upper bound on the accuracy of the MVF for the multiclass classification problem. More specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the error rate of the MVF exponentially decays toward 0 as the number of independent voters increases. Conversely, the error rate of the MVF exponentially grows with the number of voters if these conditions are not met. We first explore the problem for voters with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) outputs, where we assume that, given the true classification of the data point, every voter follows the same conditional probability distribution of voting for different classes. Next, we extend our results to encompass independent but nonidentically distributed votes. Using the derived results, we then provide a discussion on the accuracy of the truth discovery algorithms. We show that in the best-case scenarios, truth discovery algorithms operate as an amplified MVF and thereby achieve a small error rate only when the MVF achieves a small error rate too, and vice versa, achieve a large error rate when the MVF also achieves a large error rate. However, in the worst case scenario, the truth discovery algorithms may exhibit a significantly higher error rate than the MVF.

This allows the DApp users to offload the mining tasks to a cloud and/or a mobile edge computing server managed by a cloud service provider (CSP). To ensure the sustainable cloud/edge services and the integrity of blockchain, a CSP selection problem arises, which is a problem to assign the offloading requests to an appropriate CSP. In this paper, we propose a mining task offloading strategy for the CSP selection problem to maximize the miner's expected utility. More specifically, we formulate the CSP selection problem as a repeated stochastic game such that the coarse correlated equilibrium is achieved among miners (DApp users). In addition, we develop an online algorithm for efficiently solving the repeated stochastic game using the Lyapunov optimization and the drift-plus-penalty algorithm.

Suitable incentive mechanisms are essential for encouraging user participation. Current MCS work more or less ignores three factors. First, mobile users are assumed to be independent of each other, ignoring social effects. Second, due to the heterogeneity of users, if you just blindly attract users without distinguishing them, the data quality can decrease. Finally, the limited communication resource allocation problem during uploading sensing results is ignored. Therefore, we model the quality-improved and delay-aware incentive mechanism with social concerns as a two-stage Stackelberg game, in which the rational use of social effects not only motivates user participation but also avoids a serious decline in information value due to repetition, and reasonable allocation of communication resources ensures the timeliness of delay-sensitive tasks. Furthermore, data screening, similarity analysis, voting, and reputation are used simultaneously to improve data quality. The Hessian matrix in a multiuser, multitask hyperspace setting is utilized to verify the existence and uniqueness of the game equilibrium. The closed-form expressions of the optimal requester pricing and the optimal user data load strategies are derived, respectively. The proposed mechanism is compared with gather\u2013scatter, incentive- G, Blockchain-based secure, interactive, and fair MCS (BSIF), and Socially-aware incentive mechanism (SAIM) algorithms.
